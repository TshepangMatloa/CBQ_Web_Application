<h2>EXPOSURE</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>	The platform aims to solve one of the biggest challenges that SMEs have and that is exposure.</li> 
<li>	The site will be an entry point to where products and services are obtained based on the ability to deliver on the request.</li> 
<li>	The ability to deliver based on the request is indiscriminate and this will put SMEs on the same level as much more established businesses thus making them as approachable and as marketable.</li> 
<li>	Businesses on the platform will reach its consumers much faster, much better and on a much bigger scale as the site puts small businesses directly in the hands of a lot more consumers.</li> 
<li>	For this very reason, businesses will attract a whole lot more clients in need for their services.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><ul><li>	EFFICIENCY</li></ul></h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>	In any environment time is quite an important construct and it is very much the same in the business environment. The website will make acquiring suppliers, services and other business a much shorter but very efficient process.</li> 
<li>	Irrespective of size, industry or other constraints that might normally be in place when sourcing companies to meet a brief, the website will return every business that is ready and available to produce the goods or render the services depending on what is required.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<h2><ul><li>	SPECIFICATION</li></ul></h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>	When selecting businesses to provide a service or when obtaining products, what usually determines whether a vendor is chosen is 
down to whether they can deliver the product according to a set specification. The website aims to create an on-demand service 
which will allow the user to acquire products and services from various businesses that can deliver on their specifications.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<h2><ul><li>	CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT</li></ul></h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>	SMEs already face a lot of difficulties and to top it off, they operate in a very tough business environment currently in south Africa.</li> 
<li>	Putting these small businesses on the website aims to create a sort of separate market place, creating an environment that is very different from the external one.</li> 
<li>	An environment that promotes business among SMEs, an environment that brings suppliers instantly to its consumers, an environment that allows small businesses to grow in significance and achieve marketability and to create a large community of SMEs which achieve growth within a tough economy.</li>
</ul>
